# Robotic Arm with End Effector

This project features a 5-degree-of-freedom robotic arm designed using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). The arm includes a functional end effector (gripper) intended for object manipulation and basic simulation of robotic movement.

## üì¶ Contents

- `3D_Model/robot_arm.stl`: 3D model file of the robotic arm in STL format
- `README.md`: Project documentation
- `.gitignore`: Files to be ignored by Git

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Designed in Tinkercad
- 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
- End effector for gripping objects
- Suitable for educational purposes, simulation, or 3D printing

## üîß Future Enhancements

- Add servo motor control using Arduino
- Integrate with joystick or button interface
- Simulate motion via embedded systems
